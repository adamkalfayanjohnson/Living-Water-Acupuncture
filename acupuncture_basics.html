              <span><h2>Acupuncture Basics</h2><img class="dryneedle" src="./images/Dry_Needling.jpg" alt="Acupuncture needles">Acupuncture is a method
                of encouraging the body to promote natural healing and to improve functioning. This is done by inserting needles and applying heat
                or electrical stimulation at very precise acupuncture points. <br>

                <h2>How Does Acupuncture Work?</h2>The classical Chinese explanation is that channels of energy run through the body and over its surface.
                These energy channels can be influenced by needling acupuncture points to unblock obstructions to movement of energy. These obstructions
                are believed to result in illness. <br><br>

                The modern scientific explanation is that acupuncture stimulates the
                nervous system to release chemicals in the muscles, spinal cord, and brain.
                These chemicals will either change the experience of pain or
                trigger release of other chemicals which influence the body’s internal regulating system.
                The improved energy and biochemical balance produced by acupuncture stimulates the body’s
                natural healing abilities and promotes physical and emotional well-being. <br>
