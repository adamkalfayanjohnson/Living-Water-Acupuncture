                the <a href="https://acudetox.com/">National Acupuncture Detoxification Association</a>. This approach involves gentle placement of up to
                5 small disposable needles into specific sites on each ear. The person being treated sits quietly in a
                group setting for 30-45 minutes. <strong><em>This service is available on Tuesdays from 3:00 PM-6:00 PM</strong></em>.
